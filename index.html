    Hello!

  <h2>Terumah</h2>
    <p> יהוה spoke to Moses, saying: Tell the Israelite people to bring Me gifts; 
      you shall accept gifts for Me from every person whose heart is so moved.
      “Speak to the children of Israel, and they shall take Me a gift;
      from every man whose heart pledges, you shall collect My gift” 
      (Exodus 25:2).
      “They shall take Me a gift” – that is what is written:
      “For a good lesson [lekaḥ] I have given you: 
      My Torah, do not forsake it” (Proverbs 4:2).
      Do not forsake the acquisition [mikaḥ] that I gave to you. 
      You have a person who acquires an acquisition, there is gold in it 
      but there is no silver in it, there is silver in it but there is no gold 
      in it. But the acquisition that I gave you, there is silver in it, 
      as it is stated: “The sayings of the Lord are pure sayings, 
      like silver purified” (Psalms 12:7), and there is gold in it[as well] ,
      as it is stated: “They are more desirable than gold,
      than quantities of fine gold” (Psalms 19:11).
      There is a person who acquires fields but not orchards,
      orchards but not fields; but this acquisition, 
      there are fields in it and there are orchards in it, 
      as it is stated: “Your irrigated fields are an orchard of pomegranates”
      (Song of Songs 4:13).
